# Exploring Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithms for Block-Structured Mesh-and-Particle Simulations in AMReX



## **Introduction**


**Submitted to "The Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) Conference"**

This is the reproducibility artifact four our submitted paper. It includes our developed algorithms along with the AMReX framework. 

<!-- ## **Abstract** -->

<!-- Load balancing is a critical requirement for successful large-scale HPC simulations. However, traditional load-balancing strategies have competing limitations. In this research, we explore dynamic novel hybrid load balancing algorithms, starting with Bruteforce and then Knapsack and SFC, and then combining both Knapsack and SFC and SFC Painter Partition. The result stated that the Painter SFC method is the optimal algorithm for real-world applications. Initial investigations into building this algorithm are outlined as the first steps toward applying this novel algorithm to a WarpX simulation. -->

<!-- ## **Background** -->

<!-- **What is AMReX**

AMReX is the block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) software framework for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs).

• AMR is a common cause of load imbalance during simulations. Multi-level meshes lead to complex load distributions that require careful balancing to obtain optimal runtime.

• AMReX provides the necessary tools to manage and optimize computational meshes, particles, parallel processing, input/output, and visualization for high-performance simulations. -->


<!-- 
**What is Load Balancing**

• Load balancing is a process of distributing computational tasks evenly across available processors or nodes to maximize   efficiency and minimize idle time.

• AMReX provides Space-filling curve and Knapsack load balancing algorithms.

## **Prerequisites**

### **System Requirements**

- **Operating System:** macOS, Linux, or similar Unix-based systems
- **Compiler:** GCC (version 9.0 or later) or Clang supporting C++17 or later.
- **Build Tools:** make utility for building the code.
- **Shell:** Bash for running shell scripts.

### **Dependencies**

- **AMReX :** A software framework for building parallel AMR applications.
- **CMake:** Version 3.15 or later for configuring the build system.
- **MPI:** OpenMPI for parallel execution (if required). 




   
## **Getting Started**

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Installation**

1. First clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/amitashnanda/PASC_2025_Paper_Artifact.git

   cd PASC_2025_Paper_Artifact

   ```
2. Install and Build AMReX from the step here:

   https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/BuildingAMReX_Chapter.html

   Clone this repository to the working directory

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex.git

   ```
   This repository includes all ```amrex``` functionalities required to run our test-cases. So modify the ```GNUmakefile``` accordingly. Change the ```AMREX_HOME``` path to the correct path of cloned ```amrex``` repository. 

   ```
   AMREX_HOME ?= ../../../amrex

   ```

### **Build Instructions for bruteforce algorithm**

1. Navigate to the ```bruteForce``` directory

   ```
   CC bruteForce.cpp -o bf -fopenmp

   ```

### **Build Instructions for optimized algorithms**

1. Navigate to the ```optimized_algorithms``` directory

   ```
   cd /path/to/PASC_2025_Paper_Artifact/src/optimized_algorithms/

   ```
2. Configure the Makefile:

   Ensure your ```Make.package``` file includes the correct paths to ```AMReX``` headers and libraries also all files headers and sources. 

3. Compile the Code:

   ```
   make -j 

   ```
   This will generate the executable ```main3d.gnu.x86-milan.TPROF.ex ```

### **Run Instructions**

1. Navigate to the Repository Root:

   Change the ```inputs``` as per your requirement. You can change the ```mean```, ```standard_deviation```, ```no_of_runs```, ```domain_size```, ```max_grid_size``` . 

2. Run the experiment file

   ```
   ./experiment.sh

   ```
3. Direct Execution

   ```
   ./main3d.gnu.x86-milan.TPROF.ex inputs nnodes=2 domain="(256,256,256)" max_grid_size= "(128,128,128)" > output/2_4_output_worst.txt

   ```

4. Running a bash file through jobs on perlmutter

   ```
   sbatch run.sh 

   ```
